Move the ```make_sound``` code to the class ```Animal```, and modify it so that it uses the ```sound``` attribute to print the correct sound. Remove ```make_sound``` from the derived classes. You will need to change the constructor of the derived classes and the lines that create your animals accordingly, but in the end your code will be much shorter.\n",
