    "For the following exercises, you will use a dataset comprising food hygiene ratings pertaining to over 600k businesses across the UK. This is a real dataset obtained from the UK's Food Standards Agency, where each business is rated with a score from 0 (urgent improvement necessary) to 5 (very good). The dataset is provided in json format, in a file called 'food-hygiene-ratings.json'. Each entry in the dataset contains a business which, in addition to the hygiene rating score, provides information on the business type, its address, its local authority, etc.\n",
