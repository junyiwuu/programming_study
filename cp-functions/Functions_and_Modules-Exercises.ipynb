    "You now have all the tools and the knowledge to do fairly complex stuff. Let's try some data analysis -\n",
    "read [this story](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-people-are-too-superstitious-to-have-a-baby-on-friday-the-13th/) online, and download the underlying data - it's available in a [github repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/births). Read the ```README.md``` file carefully and make a note of file format, then click on ```US_births_2000-2014_SSA.csv```, click on *Raw* and use the *File>Save Page As* (or equivalent) function of your browser to save the file in  your working directory (if this does not work for you, you can download the entire repository from GitHub as you would one of our lectures, and then copy the file over).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a function that reads all the data into a list of *(year, month, date_of_month, day_of_week, births)* tuples. Remember to convert all data to type ```int```\n",
    "* Warm-up exercise: for the sake of the title, compute the average number of people born yearly on July 4th (hint: that should be around 8815.27). If you are curious, do the same for people born on Friday 13th, and people born on a Friday that's not the 13th.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data aggregation is a basic stepstone of data analysis. We can aggregate birth data with respect to each of the first  four columns to find how many people were born in each year, on each day of the week or on each date of the month.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a function called ```aggregate``` that takes as its arguments the data and the number of a \"key\" column for aggregation. The function should return a dictionary. The keys of the dictionary should be all values of the \"key\" column; the corresponding values should be the total of all births listed against each value of the \"key\" column. So for instance if the \"key\" column is number 3 (*day_of_week*), the dictionary should have keys 1 to 7 and the value for, say, key 1 should be the sum of all births for which *day_of_week* is listed as being 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: this is somewhat similar to the \"Counting Vowels\" exercise (in both \"Collections\" and \"Files\" lectures), except the key values now are taken from the data table itself, and increments are given by the number of births. If you get stuck, try hard-coding it for the *day_of_week* column only, move on to the following part, test the two functions together, and then come back to this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a function called ```print_stats``` that takes as its argument an aggregated data dictionary as returned by ```aggregate``` and prints it out as a nice table of key-value pairs, sorted by key.\n",

    "* Use the above two functions to compute and tabulate the total number of births in each year, on each day of the week, in each month and on each date of the month. Can you spot any interesting trends?\n",

    "**NOTE:** This is a slightly more complex exercise - you may not have the time to go beyond the warm-up part in class, but we recommend you attempt the rest in your own time. Be prepared for the second part to require some thinking. This exercise is also, like all exploratory data analysis tasks, very open-ended - if you want to do more, you can modify the ```histogram``` function to take a dictionary as its input, and use it to plot the percentage of people born on each day of the week, month or date of the month. You can also try analysing the data in the other birth data file, ```US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv```, that is formatted in the same way, and see if any trends you identified are confirmed in the longer term."
